// RelativePointerRelativeMotionEvent : relative pointer motion
//
// Relative x/y pointer motion from the pointer of the seat associated with
// this object.
//
// A relative motion is in the same dimension as regular wl_pointer motion
// events, except they do not represent an absolute position. For example,
// moving a pointer from (x, y) to (x', y') would have the equivalent
// relative motion (x' - x, y' - y). If a pointer motion caused the
// absolute pointer position to be clipped by for example the edge of the
// monitor, the relative motion is unaffected by the clipping and will
// represent the unclipped motion.
//
// This event also contains non-accelerated motion deltas. The
// non-accelerated delta is, when applicable, the regular pointer motion
// delta as it was before having applied motion acceleration and other
// transformations such as normalization.
//
// Note that the non-accelerated delta does not represent 'raw' events as
// they were read from some device. Pointer motion acceleration is device-
// and configuration-specific and non-accelerated deltas and accelerated
// deltas may have the same value on some devices.
//
// Relative motions are not coupled to wl_pointer.motion events, and can be
// sent in combination with such events, but also independently. There may
// also be scenarios where wl_pointer.motion is sent, but there is no
// relative motion. The order of an absolute and relative motion event
// originating from the same physical motion is not guaranteed.
//
// If the client needs button events or focus state, it can receive them
// from a wl_pointer object of the same seat that the wp_relative_pointer
// object is associated with.
